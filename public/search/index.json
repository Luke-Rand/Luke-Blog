[{"categories":null,"content":"Why I moved my blog from Wordpress to Hugo Why are you making a big deal about this? You only have one article on your blog! Are you ever going to write about what you\u0026rsquo;re working on, or are you just going to keep re-inventing the wheel?\nYeah\u0026hellip; Great questions.\nI do have a counter to that last question, though. This move is exactly the kind of project I want to work on and write about. My homelab is my playground. Shaking things up is what makes this project so fun. And, as I\u0026rsquo;ll explain in a bit, this move will allow me to practice some important skills when it comes to DevOps practices.\nSpeed and security I won\u0026rsquo;t get into explaining what Hugo is in this article, but just know that it is what is called a \u0026ldquo;static site generator\u0026rdquo;. That means that I can write a blog post in markdown and run a few commands to automatically generate a website from those files. Beyond that, this site is what is called a \u0026ldquo;static site\u0026rdquo;. Static webpages stand in contrast to standard webpages which are classified as \u0026ldquo;dynamic\u0026rdquo;.\nThese static pages have numerous advantages over dynamic sites. A big one for me is that they are much faster to load because there is no server-side computation going on and there\u0026rsquo;s also much less work being done by the client (your web browser.) Load times are considerably faster than what I was seeing on my Wordpress site running in a Docker container. The other huge benefit of static sites is that they are less susceptible to security vulnerabilities. There is far less (if any) Javascript being executed that could be exploited by attackers. But being better than Wordpress at security is kind of a low bar anyway.\nPipelines HugoÂ canÂ beÂ easilyÂ integratedÂ withÂ continuousÂ integrationÂ andÂ continuousÂ deliveryÂ (CI/CD)Â pipelines.Â ThisÂ meansÂ thatÂ youÂ canÂ automateÂ theÂ processÂ ofÂ buildingÂ andÂ deployingÂ yourÂ website.Â ForÂ example,Â IÂ useÂ GitHubÂ ActionsÂ toÂ automaticallyÂ buildÂ andÂ deployÂ myÂ siteÂ everyÂ timeÂ IÂ pushÂ changesÂ toÂ myÂ GitÂ repository.Â ThisÂ isÂ aÂ hugeÂ benefitÂ forÂ me,Â asÂ itÂ allowsÂ meÂ toÂ automateÂ theÂ deploymentÂ processÂ andÂ ensureÂ thatÂ myÂ websiteÂ isÂ alwaysÂ upÂ toÂ date.\nMore control WithÂ Hugo,Â IÂ haveÂ moreÂ controlÂ overÂ theÂ lookÂ andÂ feelÂ ofÂ myÂ site.Â IÂ canÂ createÂ myÂ ownÂ themesÂ andÂ layouts,Â andÂ IÂ canÂ customizeÂ theÂ wayÂ myÂ contentÂ isÂ displayed.Â IÂ alsoÂ haveÂ moreÂ controlÂ overÂ theÂ underlyingÂ code,Â whichÂ givesÂ meÂ theÂ flexibilityÂ toÂ addÂ customÂ featuresÂ andÂ functionality.Â ThisÂ isÂ greatÂ forÂ me,Â asÂ IÂ wantÂ learn more about web development anyway.\nTransparency Both Hugo and Wordpress are open source, which is great. I have confidence that the community of passionate maintainers will keep both services free and secure.\nHowever, Wordpress is mostly maintained by a single corporate interest, Automattic. Because of this, the future of Wordpress is slightly more questionable than Hugo.\nUsing Hugo also has the added benefit of making it easier to open source my site. Right now you can go to my Github page and view the entire source code for my blog. Pretty neat!\nHow it Hugo fits into my PKM system IÂ useÂ aÂ PKMÂ (personalÂ knowledgeÂ management)Â systemÂ toÂ organizeÂ myÂ notes,Â articles,Â andÂ otherÂ digitalÂ resources.Â HugoÂ canÂ beÂ integratedÂ withÂ myÂ PKMÂ systemÂ toÂ automaticallyÂ generateÂ blogÂ postsÂ fromÂ myÂ notes.Â ThisÂ allowsÂ meÂ toÂ easilyÂ shareÂ myÂ knowledgeÂ withÂ othersÂ andÂ toÂ keepÂ myÂ blogÂ upÂ toÂ dateÂ withÂ myÂ latestÂ thinking.Â Plus, I already use Obsidian which is a natively markdown note taking application. Because of this, publishing a blog post is as easy as copying one of my notes into my Hugo repo.\nConclusion Overall,Â I\u0026rsquo;mÂ reallyÂ happyÂ withÂ myÂ decisionÂ toÂ moveÂ myÂ blogÂ fromÂ WordpressÂ toÂ Hugo.Â I\u0026rsquo;veÂ noticedÂ aÂ significantÂ improvementÂ inÂ speedÂ andÂ security,Â andÂ IÂ haveÂ moreÂ controlÂ overÂ theÂ lookÂ andÂ feelÂ ofÂ myÂ site.Â I\u0026rsquo;mÂ alsoÂ excitedÂ aboutÂ theÂ potentialÂ forÂ usingÂ HugoÂ toÂ automateÂ myÂ bloggingÂ workflowÂ andÂ integrateÂ itÂ withÂ myÂ PKMÂ system.\nI\u0026rsquo;mÂ alsoÂ lookingÂ forwardÂ toÂ usingÂ thisÂ moveÂ asÂ anÂ opportunityÂ toÂ learnÂ moreÂ aboutÂ DevOpsÂ practices.Â ByÂ usingÂ GitHubÂ ActionsÂ toÂ automateÂ myÂ deploymentÂ process,Â I\u0026rsquo;mÂ gettingÂ hands-onÂ experienceÂ withÂ aÂ keyÂ DevOpsÂ tool.\nOfÂ course,Â thereÂ areÂ someÂ downsidesÂ toÂ usingÂ Hugo.Â It\u0026rsquo;sÂ notÂ asÂ easyÂ toÂ useÂ asÂ Wordpress,Â andÂ there\u0026rsquo;sÂ aÂ smallerÂ communityÂ ofÂ users.Â However,Â I\u0026rsquo;mÂ confidentÂ thatÂ theÂ benefitsÂ ofÂ usingÂ HugoÂ outweighÂ theÂ drawbacks.\nIfÂ you\u0026rsquo;reÂ consideringÂ movingÂ yourÂ blogÂ toÂ Hugo,Â IÂ encourageÂ youÂ toÂ giveÂ itÂ aÂ try.Â It\u0026rsquo;sÂ aÂ greatÂ wayÂ toÂ improveÂ theÂ speed,Â security,Â andÂ controlÂ ofÂ yourÂ site.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-moved-my-blog-from-wordpress-to-hugo/","tags":null,"title":"Why I Moved My Blog From Wordpress to Hugo"},{"categories":null,"content":"My goals for this blog I have way too many hobbies, projects, and plans. I would say this is a good problem to have, but things pile up sometimes. I think a big reason for that is that I often get in my own way. The motivation is there but I need something to get excited about in order to get over that initial hump.\nI want to do what I do, and prove that I do it I want to have tangible output when I finish a project. I want the satisfaction of making something, even when I\u0026rsquo;m doing something as mundane as updating software in my homelab. Hell, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even have a newfound motivation to automate new processes if I also get to write about it.\nI want to deepen my understanding Watching a YouTube tutorial can only get you so far. I learn a lot just by doing, but how long do I hold on to that information? I feel like following a tutorial often gets me a surface-level understanding of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to learn. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen plenty of suggestions online that a cheat code of sorts to deepening understanding on a topic is to write it down. I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about jotting down some throwaway notes, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about doing my research and having intentionality behind what I write.\nI want a creative outlet I just love making things. As an example, I recently started making short videos of my film photography process that I posted to Instagram on a whim. It was so fun. I must have gone back and re-watched those videos tens of times. Being able to express myself is important to my identity. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping producing well thought out blog posts will also scratch that itch.\nThis is my corner of the internet, just for me I will make this spot my own, and make it a living representation of who I am and what I\u0026rsquo;m interested in.\nTopics to expect Homelab projects DevOps / Platform Engineering topics Film Photography Gaming Coffee Personal knowledge management ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-goals-for-this-blog/","tags":["blog"],"title":"My goals for this blog"},{"categories":null,"content":"ğŸ‘‹ Hi!
