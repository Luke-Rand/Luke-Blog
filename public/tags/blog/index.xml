      <description>My goals for this blog I have way too many hobbies, projects, and plans. I would say this is a good problem to have, but things pile up sometimes. I think a big reason for that is that I often get in my own way. The motivation is there but I need something to get excited about in order to get over that initial hump.&#xA;I want to do what I do, and prove that I do it I want to have tangible output when I finish a project.</description>
