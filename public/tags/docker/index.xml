      <description>Self-hosting a wiki for my TTRPG group I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of an ongoing series of TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying Games) for a few years now. I&amp;rsquo;m so fortunate to have a group of friends that are committed enough to keep a game going for this long, and we even play in our office which is pretty cool.&#xA;Of course there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that goes into making these games happen. One thing we do to make this easier is sharing the responsibilities for running the game between all of us.</description>
