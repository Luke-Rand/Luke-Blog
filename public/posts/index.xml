      <description>Self-hosting a wiki for my TTRPG group I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of an ongoing series of TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying Games) for a few years now. I&amp;rsquo;m so fortunate to have a group of friends that are committed enough to keep a game going for this long, and we even play in our office which is pretty cool.&#xA;Of course there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that goes into making these games happen. One thing we do to make this easier is sharing the responsibilities for running the game between all of us.</description>

      <description>Why I moved my blog from Wordpress to Hugo Why are you making a big deal about this? You only have one article on your blog! Are you ever going to write about what you&amp;rsquo;re working on, or are you just going to keep re-inventing the wheel?&#xA;Yeah&amp;hellip; Great questions.&#xA;I do have a counter to that last question, though. This move is exactly the kind of project I want to work on and write about.</description>

      <description>My goals for this blog I have way too many hobbies, projects, and plans. I would say this is a good problem to have, but things pile up sometimes. I think a big reason for that is that I often get in my own way. The motivation is there but I need something to get excited about in order to get over that initial hump.&#xA;I want to do what I do, and prove that I do it I want to have tangible output when I finish a project.</description>
