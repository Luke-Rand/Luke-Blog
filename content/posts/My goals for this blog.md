# My goals for this blog

I have way too many hobbies, projects, and plans. I would say this is a good problem to have, but things pile up sometimes. I think a big reason for that is that I often get in my own way. The motivation is there but I need something to get *excited* about in order to get over that initial hump.

## I want to do what I do, and prove that I do it

I want to have tangible output when I finish a project. I want the satisfaction of *making something*, even when I'm doing something as mundane as updating software in my homelab. Hell, maybe I'll even have a newfound motivation to automate new processes if I also get to write about it.

## I want to deepen my understanding

Watching a YouTube tutorial can only get you so far. I learn a lot just by doing, but how long do I hold on to that information? I feel like following a tutorial often gets me a surface-level understanding of what I'm trying to learn. I've seen plenty of suggestions online that a cheat code of sorts to deepening understanding on a topic is to write it down. I'm not talking about jotting down some throwaway notes, I'm talking about doing my research and having intentionality behind what I write.

## I want a creative outlet

I just love making things. As an example, I recently started making short videos of my film photography process that I posted to Instagram on a whim. *It was so fun.* I must have gone back and re-watched those videos tens of times. Being able to express myself is important to my identity. I'm hoping producing well thought out blog posts will also scratch that itch.

## This is my corner of the internet, just for me

I will make this spot my own, and make it a living representation of who I am and what I'm interested in.

## Topics to expect

- Homelab projects
